### 344. How does Incremental Refresh work in Power BI, and why is it important?  
**Answer:**  
Incremental Refresh allows Power BI to load only new or modified data during scheduled refreshes instead of reloading the entire dataset. This significantly improves performance and reduces resource consumption, especially for large datasets. It is configured using Power Query parameters like `RangeStart` and `RangeEnd` along with filtering logic on a datetime column.

### 345. What is the difference between Push, Streaming, and Hybrid datasets in Power BI?  
**Answer:**  
- **Push Dataset:** Data is sent to Power BI using API calls and stored in the Power BI service. Ideal for small, periodic updates.  
- **Streaming Dataset:** Data is displayed in real-time but not stored permanently. Used for live dashboards, typically fed by IoT or telemetry data.  
- **Hybrid Dataset:** Combines benefits of both—data is cached for historical reference, while real-time data updates via streaming.  

---

### 346. How can memory limitations in Power BI Service be addressed?  
**Answer:**  
- Reduce dataset size using data aggregations and summarizations.  
- Use Incremental Refresh to avoid reloading full historical data.  
- Optimize the data model by removing unnecessary columns, using appropriate data types, and minimizing relationships and cardinality.  

---

### 347. What are common reasons for dataset refresh failures in Power BI and how do you troubleshoot them?  
**Answer:**  
- **Invalid credentials:** Re-authenticate data sources.  
- **Gateway issues:** Ensure the On-Premises Gateway is installed, running, and updated.  
- **Query timeouts:** Optimize Power Query transformations and DAX calculations.  
- Use the refresh history and Power BI service logs to identify and resolve issues.  

---

### 348. What are best practices for managing large-scale enterprise deployments in Power BI?  
**Answer:**  
- Leverage Power BI Datamarts for self-service and SQL-based querying.

- Poorly written or non-optimized DAX measures.  
- High-cardinality columns and excessive bidirectional filtering.  

---

### 350. How do you debug and optimize DAX expressions?  
**Answer:**  
- Use DAX Studio to analyze and benchmark query performance.  
- Break down complex DAX into intermediate steps using calculated tables or variables.  
- Use the `EVALUATE` statement in external tools to inspect results and logic.  

---

### 351. What are recurring causes of Power BI dataset refresh failures?  
**Answer:**  
- Gateway connection issues for on-premises sources.  
- Expired credentials for cloud-based or API sources.  
- Poorly optimized transformations leading to timeouts or memory overflows.  
- Changes in schema or data source structure not reflected in the dataset.  

---

### 352. How do you improve visual performance in Power BI dashboards?  
**Answer:**  
- Replace detailed tables with aggregated visuals.  
- Reduce the number of interactive slicers and cross-filtered visuals.  
- Minimize usage of high-cardinality columns and nested measures.  
- Enable Performance Analyzer to review and optimize visual load times.  

---

### 353. Why can DirectQuery performance be suboptimal in Power BI?  
**Answer:**  
- Queries are executed on the source system, so complex joins or transformations slow down performance.  
- High-cardinality columns can generate expensive queries.  
- Network latency and concurrency issues affect real-time interactivity.  
- Limited support for some advanced Power Query and DAX features.  

---

### 354. How can DAX queries be debugged effectively?  
**Answer:**  
- Use DAX Studio for in-depth analysis of storage engine (SE) and formula engine (FE) behavior.  
- Use `DEFINE MEASURE` and `EVALUATE` to isolate specific calculations.  
- Use VertiPaq Analyzer for evaluating data model storage structure and cardinality issues.  

---

### 355. What are best practices for handling Power BI Gateway errors?  
**Answer:**  
- Restart the On-Premises Gateway service if it becomes unresponsive.  
- Check firewall, proxy, and network settings that may block the gateway connection.  
- Keep the gateway updated and ensure the user has proper permissions.  
- Use Gateway Logs and the Power BI Service Diagnostics Tool to trace errors.  

---

### 356. What is Query Folding in Power Query and why is it important?  
**Answer:**  
Query Folding refers to the ability of Power Query to push transformations back to the data source (e.g., SQL Server) for processing. This optimizes performance by reducing data volume transferred to Power BI and leveraging the processing power of the source system.

---

### 357. How can Power Query performance be optimized?  
**Answer:**  
- Minimize the number of transformation steps.  
- Use buffered tables for reusable intermediate results.  
- Ensure query folding is maintained—avoid breaking folding with unsupported functions early in the query.  
- Filter rows early to reduce data volume.  

---

### 358. What challenges might arise when using Power BI with big data sources?  
**Answer:**  
- Performance issues due to large volumes and high cardinality.  
- Limited capability of DirectQuery for complex or nested queries.  
- Memory constraints in Power BI Desktop and service.  
- Need for well-designed star schemas, aggregations, and partitioning to improve usability and performance.  

---

### 359. What is the role of Aggregations in Power BI, and how do they improve performance?  
**Answer:**  
Aggregations summarize detailed data at a higher level, reducing the amount of data queried during report rendering. They can be manually or automatically configured and work especially well with DirectQuery models, allowing fast performance on large datasets.

---

### 360. How do you implement Role-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI?  
**Answer:**  
Define roles using DAX filters within the model and assign them via the Power BI Service. RLS ensures users only see data they’re permitted to access. It’s important for compliance and secure multi-tenant reporting.

---

### 361. What is the difference between Import Mode and DirectQuery Mode in Power BI?  
**Answer:**  
- **Import Mode:** Data is stored in memory (VertiPaq), resulting in faster performance and more modeling capabilities.  
- **DirectQuery Mode:** Data stays in the source and is queried in real-time. Suitable for large or real-time datasets but has performance and feature limitations.  

---

### 362. What are Composite Models in Power BI?  
**Answer:**  
Composite Models allow combining Import and DirectQuery tables in a single dataset. This hybrid model gives flexibility to balance performance and real-time needs.

---

### 363. How do Power BI Dataflows differ from Datasets?  
**Answer:**  
Dataflows are cloud-based ETL pipelines using Power Query Online, designed for reusability across workspaces.  
Datasets are semantic models used in reports. Dataflows can feed into datasets for modular data architecture.

---

### 364. How do you track dataset refresh history and performance in Power BI Service?  
**Answer:**  
Use the Dataset Settings page to view refresh status, success/failure logs, and duration. Also, Power BI REST APIs and Admin portal reports can provide automated monitoring.

---

### 365. What is the difference between Report Server and Power BI Service?  
**Answer:**
